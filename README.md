# lambdasamplescognizant
Hi. The Idea of this short set of samples is to help to start working with Lambda expressions and functional interfaces.
The source code is organized in 3 packages:

1.Annotations: Annotations to defined a set of Authors are here. A test class is also there to show how to retrieve the values of 
the Authors using a lambda expression

2.Lambdas: A set of classes is here to demostrate the use of functional interfaces, method references and lambdas. Try to run all 
the sample classes that contain a main method

3.Util: A sample of Inner a class and a skeleton is here for you to play around

The project was created with IntelliJ and Maven but can work in any IDE
